# CHIP-8
 An implementation of the CHIP-8 emulator using Python for graphics/controls and C for execution

## Introduction
 During my freshman year of college, I wrote an emulator for the CHIP-8 using nothing but pure python. The result was a clunky, slow emulator that barely ran (but it did still run). My goal with this project is to write another emulator, but this time using Python's ctypes library to do the heavy lifting for the emulation side, and some Python library for the graphics side (I'm thinking Tkinter or PyGame, but I'm not sure yet). Hopefully the result will be a faster and more usable emulator, and I can finally fulfill my dream of emulating a bootleg version of Pac-Man on an obsolete machine that will probably very little actual use (it's the experience that matters, right?).
